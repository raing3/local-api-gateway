To do:

 * Tests.
 * Readme - document CLI commands, config structure.
 * Github workflow for CI and publish.
 * Better example.
 * More error handling + validation of config file.
 * Install gateway version that matches the CLI version.
 * CORS middleware.

Maybe:

 * Command to git pull integrations.
